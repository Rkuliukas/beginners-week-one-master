Therefore I have aquired a more accessable, and just as lovable receipe for you to try at home! I personally love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, and remember excessive drooling when watching the scene in The Simpsons Movie when Ned Flanders creates the ultimate Hot Chocolate for Bart. I have found a amazing chef and blogger; the exceptional <a href="https://www.bingingwithbabish.com">Binging with Babish</a> who has created this amazingly mouth watering, soul soothing and life fullfilling receipe, which I have shared with you below.</p>
