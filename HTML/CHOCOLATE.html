      <h2> What is Chocolate? <h2>
        <p>Chocolate is a tasty brown treat which comes in the form of a block, but can be melted into a thick liquid. Chocolate can be consumed by itself or added to any food/reciepe as a delicous flavouring ingredient, such as Cake and Ice Cream.</p>

      <h2> How is Chocolate made? <h2>
        <p>Chocolate is made with these ingredients:</p>
          <li>Cocoa bean</li>
          <li>Milk or alternatiive</li>
          <li>Sugar</li>
        <p>Have you ever wondered why the texture and flavour of chocolate varies when made by different brands? Me too! Well, is turns out that the process in which all the ingredients are added and combined can change the whole outcome!</p>
      <h2>The Best Hot Chocolate of ALL TIME </h2>
        <p>I realised it would probably a bit challanging to make delicious chocolate from scratch at home, not everyone lives in the perfect climate to house and nurture a cocoa tree. Therefore I have aquired a more accessable, and just as lovable receipe for you to try at home! I personally love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>, and remember excessive drooling when watching the scene in The Simpsons Movie when Ned Flanders creates the ultimate Hot Chocolate for Bart. I have linked the You Tube video below, created by the exceptional <a href="https://www.bingingwithbabish.com">Binging with Babish</a>.</p>
